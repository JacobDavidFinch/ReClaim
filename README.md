# ReClaim

WIP: A web application based on best learning practices. The idea will be to utilize flashcards, quizzes, and all things retention. It's built around the idea of not-filling a leaking bucket, and reclaiming that which you've already reviewed. Inspriation drawn from "Ultralearning" by Scott Young. 

## Installation

At the root run command.

```bash
npm i
```

Next to launch

```bash
npm run dev
```
